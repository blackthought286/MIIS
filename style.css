/*
	This theme has received inspirations from many places most notably HTML 5 Reset theme by Monkey Do and 
	The Blank Theme by Chris Coyier & Jeff Star. I started  off with the Blank theme for a lot of my Wordpress 
	projects but was inspired to create my own HTML 5 version when I saw The HTML 5 Reset Theme. Also I am looking
	to integrate or at least use some of the features from the Twitter Bootstrap project. 
	
	With the MIIS framework theme I wanted to make sure that there was room for adding extra features. This is not
	meant to be a completely minimalist framework like the others. There will be more features added later on. But it is also not meant
	to be a full featured theme either. Hopefuly we will get somewhere that is in a nice middle.
